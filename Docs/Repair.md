# A little introduction

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your trying to repair a macbook/any apple product this is **not the place**
> Apple has made it exeptionaly difficult without any tooling to open their devices
> They glue everything they can together to make it harder
> Go to [Ifixit](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Mac)



![NOTE]
> Companys tend to say that doing this kind of thing
> will some how damage the device
> If its not serviced by their "Licensed Technicians"
> Its just straightup false most of the time[^1]
